(Intro)
Oh, Sedda on Investing, the master of the call,
Arrogant and loud, he’s got advice for all.
“Buy low, sell high, my target’s always near!”
But when he’s dead wrong, he’ll suddenly disappear.

(Verse 1)
“Gold to 1500, short it all today!”
But gold hits 3000, Sedda’s gone away.
Then back a week later, like nothing went wrong,
Claiming he predicted it all along.

"Tesla’s dropping hard, I’ve drawn the perfect line,"
Tesla soars instead, but Sedda’s doing fine.
"It’s just a fake breakout, the market’s all a con,
My next call’s golden—just wait, hold on!"

(Chorus)
Sedda, Sedda, King of the trade,
Arrogant and ruthless, his fame’s homemade.
Misses left, misses right, still he’ll claim he’s blessed,
On Investing.com, Sedda’s the best!

(Verse 2)
Crypto’s his kingdom, he rules it with flair,
“Bitcoin’s crashing soon!” (but it triples out there).
When his calls go bust, he vanishes fast,
Then reappears smugly, “My strategy’s vast!”

He mocks all the noobs, his tone always rude,
“You don’t get the market, your brain’s just crude.”
But when someone claps back, he ducks and he hides,
Waiting for his moment to again "preside."

(Chorus)
Sedda, Sedda, Master of disguise,
Every loss forgotten, every win’s a prize.
Charts that glitter, arrogance supreme,
On Investing.com, Sedda’s the dream!

(Bridge)
He’s the king of the forum, the troll of the trade,
With words as sharp as the calls he’s made.
But when the market flips, and Sedda’s in the red,
He logs off quietly, leaving threads for dead.

(Outro)
So here’s to Sedda, the forum’s bold knight,
With arrogance by day and silence by night.
Raise a glass to his targets, his unshaken grin,
In Sedda’s wild world, he’ll always win!
